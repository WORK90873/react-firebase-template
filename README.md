# About this template

React typescript with firebase. No server code is required.
By default, the environment variable `BROWSER=none` because that's just a personal preference and I hate react popping up a tab in my browser, remove it if you'd like to.

# Get started

The most important step of actually using this template is to fill all the environment variables in [`.env.local`](/.env.local)

After doing so, you can just start developing your site.

# **_ONE FINAL THING, UNCOMMENT THE LINE OF .env.local IN GITIGNORE!!!_**
